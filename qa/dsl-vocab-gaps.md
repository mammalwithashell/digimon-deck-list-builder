# DSL Vocabulary Gaps Tracker

This file accumulates `BLOCKED` verdicts whose `gap_kind` is `dsl` (the engine has the primitive but the DSL lacks a verb that lowers to it). Entries are appended by `/batch-implement-cards-rust-dsl`.

Format per entry:

```
## <CARD_ID> — <clause name>
- Effect text: "..."
- Missing DSL verb / step kind / predicate: ...
- Lowers to engine API: <method on EffectContext that already exists>
- Suggested DSL syntax: <YAML shape>
- First reported: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## BT23-005 — [Your Turn] cost reduction when digivolving into Reptile/Dragonkin
- Effect text: "[Your Turn] When this Digimon would digivolve into a Digimon card with the [Reptile] or [Dragonkin] trait, reduce the digivolution cost by 1."
- Missing DSL verb / step kind / predicate: `CostReductionBody` in `digimon-dsl/src/clause.rs` has no `when_this_digivolves_into` + `target_trait_has` trigger form. Existing variants are `when_playing_this: bool` and `when_any_ally_played: Option<PredicateSpec>`. Neither captures "THIS permanent is the digivolution source AND the target Digimon card has trait X".
- Companion engine gap: `scan_before_pay_cost_reduction` in `game_actions.rs` constructs `EffectReadContext` from the source permanent only — no reference to the digivolution-target hand card is threaded to the condition closure, so a predicate cannot inspect the target's traits.
- Lowers to engine API: `BeforePayCost` timing exists; fixed-amount cost reduction exists. Missing: trigger-predicate variant + target-card threading in `scan_before_pay_cost_reduction`.
- Suggested DSL syntax:
  ```yaml
  - scope: own
    kind: cost_reduction
    reduction_timing: before_pay_cost
    when_this_digivolves_into:
      target_trait_has: [Reptile, Dragonkin]
    active_when: { your_turn: true }
    amount: 1
  ```

## EX11-008 — [When Moving] timing (DSL half — see engine-gaps.md for engine half)

- Effect text: "[When Moving] [On Play] 1 of your Digimon with the [Reptile] or [Dragonkin] trait gains <Raid> and +3000 DP for the turn."
- Missing DSL verb / step kind / predicate: `[When Moving]` (DCGO `EffectTiming.OnMove`) has no DSL `when:` token. The closest existing token `on_hatch` fires for permanents already on field when an egg moves digitama→breeding — different timing.
- Lowers to engine API: needs new `EffectTiming::OnMove` variant in Rust (engine gap — see `qa/archetype-qa/engine-gaps.md`) AND a DSL token mapping to it.
- Suggested DSL syntax: `when: [on_move, on_play]` (new `on_move` token in the DSL `when` enum).
- Gap kind: hybrid (this entry tracks the DSL half; engine half tracked separately).
- First reported: 2026-04-27 (EX11-008 batch-implement-cards-rust-dsl)

# DSL Vocabulary Gaps Tracker

This file accumulates `BLOCKED` verdicts whose `gap_kind` is `dsl` (the engine has the primitive but the DSL lacks a verb that lowers to it). Entries are appended by `/batch-implement-cards-rust-dsl`.

Format per entry:

```
## <CARD_ID> — <clause name>
- Effect text: "..."
- Missing DSL verb / step kind / predicate: ...
- Lowers to engine API: <method on EffectContext that already exists>
- Suggested DSL syntax: <YAML shape>
- First reported: YYYY-MM-DD
```
